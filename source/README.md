![libusb Logo](docs/logo.png)


## About

This package contains binding to *libusb* for the [Nim](http://nim-lang.org)
programming language. libusb provides generic access to USB devices. It is
portable, requires no special privileges or elevation and supports all versions
of the USB protocol.


## Supported Platforms

The following platforms have been built and tested with **libusb 1.0.20**:

- ~~Android~~
- FreeBSD
- ~~iOS~~
- Linux
- Mac OSX
- ~~OpenBSD~~
- Windows

All APIs marked as deprecated or intended solely for backwards compatibility
have been ommitted from these bindings.


## Prerequisites

To run programs compiled with the bindings in this package you must have
**libusb** installed on your computer.

### Android

TODO

### FreeBSD

If you are using FreeBSD then libusb is most likely already installed on your
computer. You can find it in the Ports tree.

### iOS

TODO

### Linux

If you are using Linux then libusb is most likely already installed on your
computer. If your Linux distribution includes a package manager or community
repository, it likely also has the latest pre-compiled binaries for libusb.

For example, on ArchLinux you can get the library from the package manager:

`sudo pacman -Sy libusb`

Alternatively, you can download the latest source code from the libusb GitHub
repository and compile the library yourself.

### Mac OSX

The easiest way to install pre-compiled binaries is through Macports:

`sudo port install libusb`

Another option is to use Homebrew:

`brew install libusb`

You may have to add a symbolic link to the installed library, so that your
program is able to load it at run-time, for example:

`sudo ln -s /opt/local/lib/libusb-1.0.dylib /usr/lib/libusb.dylib`

Alternatively, you can download the latest source code from the libusb GitHub
repository and compile the library yourself. An Xcode project is included.

### OpenBSD

TODO

### Windows

Download the latest Windows Binaries snapshot from the *libusb* web site, copy
the ``libusb-1.0.dll`` file into your program's folder. Alternatively, you can
download and compile the DLL from the code in the *libusb* GitHub repository.

## Dependencies

This package does not have any dependencies to other Nim packages at this time.


## Usage

Import the *libusb* module from this package to make the bindings available
in your project:

```nimrod
import libusb
```
